# Fonduer Tutorials

We currently provide three tutorials to get you started with `Fonduer`. Each of
these are examples of knowledge base constructions from _richly formatted
data_.

### Hardware Tutorial

In this tutorial, we build a `Fonduer` application to tackle the task of
extracting maximum storage temperatures for specific transistor part numbers
from their datasheets.

### Hardware Figures Tutorial

In this tutorial, we build a `Fonduer` application to tackle the task of
extracting images for specific transistors from their datasheets. This
demonstrates how `Fonuder` can be used for image data in additional to text.

### Paleo Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will build a `Fonduer` application to tackle the task of
extracting formation measurements from paleontological publications.
