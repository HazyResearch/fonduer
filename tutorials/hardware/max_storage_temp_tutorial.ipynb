    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will walk through the process of using `Fonduer` to extract relations from [**richly formatted** data](https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/fonduer.html), where information is conveyed via combinations of textual, structural, tabular, and visual expressions, as seen in webpages, business reports, product specifications, and scientific literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use `Fonduer` to identify mentions of the maximum storage temperature of transistors (e.g. `150Â°C`) in a corpus of transistor datasheets from [Digikey.com](https://www.digikey.com/products/en/discrete-semiconductor-products/transistors-bipolar-bjt-single/276).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is broken into several parts, each covering a Phase of the `Fonduer` pipeline (as outlined in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05028)), and the iterative KBC process:\n",

    "3. Probabilistic Relation Classification\n",
    "4. Error Analysis and Iterative KBC\n",

    "In addition, we show how users can iteratively improve labeling functions to improve relation extraction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 1: KBC Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first phase of `Fonduer`'s pipeline, `Fonduer` uses a user specified _schema_ to initialize a relational database where the output KB will be stored. Furthermore, `Fonduer` iterates over its input _corpus_ and transforms each document into a unified data model, which captures the variability and multimodality of richly formatted data. This unified data model then servers as an intermediate representation used in the rest of the phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessed data is saved to a database. Connection strings can be specified by setting the `SNORKELDB` environment variable. If no database is specified, then SQLite at `./snorkel.db` is created by default. However, to enabled parallel execution, we use PostgreSQL throughout this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize several variables for convenience that define what the database should be called and what level of parallelization the `Fonduer` pipeline will be run with. In the code below, we use PostgreSQL as our database backend. \n",

    "A labeling function isn't anything special. It's just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` as the input argument and returns `1` if it says the Candidate should be marked as true, `-1` if it says the `Candidate` should be marked as false, and `0` if it doesn't know how to vote and abstains. In practice, many labeling functions are unipolar: it labels only 1s and 0s, or it labels only -1s and 0s.\n",

Also note that we are using `Fonduer`'s optimized batch label annotator, which runs in parallel and depends on having Postgres as the backend database. \n",

    "- `clear` can be `True` or `False`, and is `True` by default. When set to `False`, the labeling functioni table is not dropped, and the behavior of `labeler.apply` is defined by the following two parameters.\n",
    "- `update_keys` can be `True` or `False`. When `True`, the keys (which are each labeling function) are updated according to the set of labeling functions provided to the function. This should be set to `True` if new labeling functions are added. When `False`, no new LFs are evaluated and the keys of existing LFs remain the same.\n",
    "- `update_values` can be `True` or `False`. This defines how to resolve conflicts. When `True`, the values assigned to each candiate is updated to the new values when in conflict. This should be set to `True` if labeling function logic is edited, even though the name of the labeling function remains the same. When `False`, the existing labels assigned to each candidate are used, and newly computed labels are ignored.\n",
