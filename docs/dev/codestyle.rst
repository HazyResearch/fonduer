Code Style
==========

For code consistency, we have a `pre-commit`_ configuration file so that you
can easily install pre-commit hooks to run style checks before you commit your
files. You can setup our pre-commit hooks by running::

    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    $ pre-commit install

Now, each time you commit, checks will be run using the packages explained
below.

We use `black`_ as our Python code formatter with its default settings. Black
helps minimize the line diffs and allows you to not worry about formatting
during your own development. Just run black on each of your files before
committing them. 

.. tip::
    Whatever editor you use, we recommend checking out `black editor
    integrations`_ to help make the code formatting process just a few
    keystrokes.

For sorting imports, we reply on `isort`_. Our repository already includes a
`.isort.cfg` that is compatible with black. You can run a code style check on
your local machine by running our checks::

    $ make check
