Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
=================================

Here are a collection of troubleshooting questions we've seen asked. If you
run into anything not covered in this section, feel free to open an Issue_.

When I try to createdb, or use psql, I get FATAL: role "<username>" does not exist.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you just installed PostgreSQL, you probably need to add users. You will need
sudo privileges to do this.

We recommend using createuser_ to define a new PostgreSQL user account::

  $ sudo -u postgres createuser [options] [username]

.. _createuser: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createuser.html

How do I connect to PostgreSQL? I'm getting "fe\_sendauth no password supplied".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are `four main ways`_ to deal with entering passwords when you connect to
your PostgreSQL database:

1. Set the ``PGPASSWORD`` environment variable ``PGPASSWORD=<pass> psql -h
   <host> -U <user>``
2. Using a `.pgpass file to store the password`_.
3. Setting the users to `trust authentication`_ in the pg\_hba.conf file. This
   makes local development easy, but probably isn't suitable for multiuser
   environments. You can find your hba file location by running::

    $ sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW hba_file;"

4. Put the username and password in the connection URI:
   ``postgresql://<user>:<pw>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>``

I'm getting a CalledProcessError for command 'pdftotext -f 1 -l 1 -bbox-layout'?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you using Ubuntu 14.04 (or older)? Fonduer requires ``poppler-utils`` to be
version ``0.36.0`` or greater. Otherwise, the ``-bbox-layout`` option is not
available for ``pdftotext`` (`see changelog`_).

If you must use Ubuntu 14.04, you can `install manually`_. As an example, to
install ``0.53.0``::

    $ sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall
    $ wget poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.53.0.tar.xz
    $ tar -xf ./poppler-0.53.0.tar.xz
    $ cd poppler-0.53.0
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo checkinstall

We highly recommend using at least Ubuntu 16.04 though, as we haven't done
testing on 14.04 or older.

How can I use use Fonduer for documents in Languages other than English?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If available, Fonduer uses languages supported by spaCy for tokenization and
its NLP pipeline (`see spacy language support`_). We also started adding
languages with spaCy alpha support for tokenization (`see spacy alpha
languages`_). Currently, only Japanese is supported.

If you would like to use Fonduer for Japanese documents, you will first have
to install some additional packages (`see mecab on PyPI`_).

For Linux::

    $ sudo apt-get install swig libmecab-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install mecab mecab-ipadic-utf8

For OS X::

    $ brew install swig mecab
    $ brew install mecab-ipadic

Afterwards, you can use ``pip install fonduer[spacy_ja]`` to install Fonduer
with Japanese language support. If you would like to use other languages with
spaCy alpha support, which are not yet integrated in Fonduer, feel free to open
an Issue_.
