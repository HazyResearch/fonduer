Configuring Fonduer
===================

By default, Fonduer_ looks for ``.fonduer-config.yaml`` starting from the
current working directory, allowing you to have multiple configuration files
for different directories or projects. If it's not there, it looks in parent
directories. If no file is found, a default configuration will be used.

Fonduer will only ever use one ``.fonduer-config.yaml`` file. It does not look
for multiple files and will not compose configuration settings from different
files.

The default ``.fonduer-config.yaml`` configuration file is shown below::

          size: 3
